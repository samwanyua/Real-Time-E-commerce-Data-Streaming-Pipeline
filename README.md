## Real-Time E-commerce Data Streaming Pipeline

This project demonstrates a real-time data engineering pipeline for an e-commerce platform using some of the industry's most powerful technologies:

- **Apache Kafka + Zookeeper** for real-time event streaming
- **Apache Flink** for stream processing and aggregation
- **PostgreSQL** for storing raw and enriched transactional data
- **Elasticsearch** for fast, flexible search and analytics
- **Kibana** for visualizing real-time insights
- **Docker Compose** to containerize the entire stack

---

## Use Case

Simulated user behavior on an e-commerce site, such as:

- Viewing products
- Adding items to a cart
- Completing purchases

These actions generate events, which are streamed through Kafka, processed by Flink, stored in PostgreSQL, indexed in Elasticsearch, and visualized in Kibana.
